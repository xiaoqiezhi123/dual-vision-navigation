description: Use when working on cuVSLAM CI/CD - the GitHub Actions nightly and PR-verify pipelines, dataset provisioning and staging, the evaluation run and KPI reporting, the build/test/lint matrix, branch rulesets, or repository secrets and variables. Covers adding a dataset, changing dataset format or packing, and controlling which datasets run in PR versus nightly.

# cuVSLAM CI/CD

CI/CD runs build, unit test, lint, dataset evaluation, dataset provisioning, and
nightly releases on GitHub Actions with self-hosted GPU and Jetson runners. This
file is the task entry point. Read [reference.md](reference.md) for the
architecture, the secrets and variables, and the load-bearing constraints before
changing anything.

## Component map

Workflows (`.github/workflows/`):

- `pr-verify.yml` - lint, then build + unit test on x86, Orin, and Thor; eval on the x86 job (fork-gated); posts a KPI table to the PR comment.
- `nightly.yml` - scheduled/manual build + test matrix; eval on the four x86 configs; writes per-config KPI history and versioned Actions artifacts. Scheduled runs never create a Release. A manual dispatch from a matching `release/vX.Y.Z` branch promotes the same distributable bytes to a protected draft GitHub Release.
- `provision-datasets.yml` - manual `workflow_dispatch` on the default branch; downloads, converts, and uploads a dataset tarball to S3. The only writer of dataset storage.
- `sync-rulesets.yml` - applies `.github/rulesets/default-branch-ruleset.json` through the API.

CI scripts (`scripts/`):

- `Dockerfile.ci` - the shared `cuvslam-ci:local` image (git, python3, pre-commit, GPG-verified AWS CLI, jq).
- `datasets_config.sh` - dataset registry: `PROVISIONABLE_DATASETS`, `EVAL_DATASET_NAMES`, path helpers, `s3_tarball_uri` (names `<name>.tar`).
- `provision_dataset.sh` - calls the dataset prepare script, tars the converted output (uncompressed `.tar`), uploads to S3.
- `stage_eval_datasets.sh` - downloads `<name>.tar` from S3, extracts to the local cache.
- `check_eval_prerequisites.sh` - verifies credentials/cache and `RUNNER_STORAGE_ROOT`.
- `eval_cuvslam_in_docker.sh` - host wrapper: mounts datasets and KPI history, starts the eval container.
- `run_eval.sh` - in container: the active dataset set `DATASETS[]`, runs `cuvslam_app.py`, then the KPI reporter.
- `cuvslam_kpi_report.py` - KPI math, Markdown `.table`, soft drift check.
- `kpi_baseline_ranges.json` - committed static drift ranges.
- `package_cpp_dist.sh` - creates and validates the curated, versioned C++ SDK archive used by Actions and Releases.
- `Dockerfile` / `build_cuvslam_in_docker.sh` - product build image and wrapper; preserve Git/LFS metadata used by
  `get_version()`.

Dataset tooling: `tools/python_tools/cuvslam_tools/dataset_preparation/<name>/` (download + `prepare_<name>.sh`), `tools/cuvslam_app/` (eval runner and `edex_reader.py`).

## Task: add a dataset

1. In `scripts/datasets_config.sh`, add the name to `PROVISIONABLE_DATASETS` and add its `dataset_upload_subdir` case (empty string means the converted root; otherwise the subdir under the converted output).
2. Add `tools/python_tools/cuvslam_tools/dataset_preparation/<name>/prepare_<name>.sh` (plus a download script) that converts raw data to the edex layout under `--output-dir`. `dataset_prepare_script` resolves `tools/python_tools/cuvslam_tools/dataset_preparation/<name>/prepare_<name>.sh`.
3. Add the dataset to the `dataset` choice input in `provision-datasets.yml`.
4. Run Provision dataset (`workflow_dispatch`) on the default branch. It writes `<S3_DATASETS_BUCKET>/<name>.tar`.
5. Add the name to `EVAL_DATASET_NAMES` in `datasets_config.sh`, and add a record to `DATASETS[]` in `scripts/run_eval.sh`: `LABEL|link_name|subdir|test_config|app_flags`.
6. Add expected KPI ranges for the dataset to `scripts/kpi_baseline_ranges.json`.

## Task: change dataset format or packing

A dataset moves through four stages. Change the one that owns the format, and keep packing and extraction in sync.

- Conversion (raw to stored layout, e.g. images vs mp4): `tools/python_tools/cuvslam_tools/dataset_preparation/<name>/prepare_<name>.sh` and the converter it calls.
- Tarball packing: `scripts/provision_dataset.sh` creates an uncompressed `.tar` (`tar -cf`); `s3_tarball_uri` names it `<name>.tar`.
- Extraction: `scripts/stage_eval_datasets.sh` runs `tar -xf`.
- In-archive layout consumed at eval: `tools/cuvslam_app/cuvslam_app.py` and `tools/cuvslam_app/edex_reader.py` (already reads per-folder `<folder>.tar` archives).

Do not reintroduce gzip: provisioning uses uncompressed `.tar` to cap memory on the provisioning runner. If packing changes, change extraction in the same MR.

## Task: control the PR vs nightly matrix

- Nightly configs: `nightly.yml` `strategy.matrix.include`. Eval runs on entries flagged `eval: true` (currently the four x86 configs). Every eval-enabled config needs the `RUNNER_STORAGE_ROOT` mount and configured repo secrets/variables; the `cuvslam-ci:local` image supplies the AWS CLI.
- PR config: `pr-verify.yml` runs eval only on `build-test-x86` (fork-gated). `EVAL_CONFIG` is the static slug label for the PR table.
- Active dataset set: `DATASETS[]` in `run_eval.sh` is global; PR and nightly run the same set. There is no per-pipeline dataset selection today. To run a different set in PR vs nightly, add an env-selected subset in `run_eval.sh` and have each workflow pass the selector.

## Task: preserve nightly version provenance

`VERSION` controls the package filename, while `get_version()` is generated independently as
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH+<short-git-sha>[-modified]`. The `-modified` suffix means the build container's
tracked worktree differs from `HEAD`.

1. Keep `git-lfs` installed and configured system-wide in `scripts/Dockerfile`. Nightly pulls LFS objects on the host,
   and Git without the LFS clean filter misidentifies the materialized files as source modifications.
2. Do not edit tracked files before the C++ build. Pass runner-specific settings such as the Ubuntu Ports mirror
   through Docker build arguments instead.
3. Keep `CUVSLAM_REQUIRE_CLEAN_SOURCE=1` on nightly C++ builds. It checks the source using the same image and Git/LFS
   configuration that generate the version header.
4. Pass the expected package version and checked-out full Git SHA to `verify_pycuvslam_wheel_in_docker.sh`. The
   verifier must reject `-modified` and a mismatched embedded revision before artifacts are uploaded.
5. When changing checkout, LFS, Docker build, or version logic, test both an LFS-materialized clean checkout and an
   intentional tracked edit.

## Task: build a draft release

1. Create or update a branch named `release/vMAJOR.MINOR[.PATCH][-SUFFIX]`.
2. Manually dispatch `Nightly Build & Test` from that branch. Release dispatches always build, even without commits in the last 24 hours.
3. After every matrix job and evaluation succeeds, the workflow validates the branch version against `VERSION`, derives the tag from the branch (`release/v17.0` -> `v17.0`), and creates a draft Release containing the already-built C++ archives, wheels, documentation, and permanent evaluation bundle.
4. Review the draft and publish it manually. A draft/published Release or Git tag with the same version is never overwritten.
5. To rebuild an unpublished release after fixes, explicitly delete the old draft and dispatch the updated release branch again.

Scheduled nightlies publish only versioned 30-day Actions artifacts. They never create or update a GitHub Release.

## Hard rules

Detail in [reference.md](reference.md). The load-bearing ones:

- Dataset and eval steps stay fork-gated (`if: ... head.repo == github.repository`); never run fork code on dataset runners.
- Eval uses the read-only `AWS_S3_RO_*` secrets; only `provision-datasets.yml` uses the read-write `AWS_S3_*` pair.
- KPI history directories and eval artifact names carry the `platform-cuda-ubuntu` slug so matrix configs never overwrite each other.
- Nightly distributables must report `VERSION+<short-checked-out-sha>` without `-modified`.
- Ruleset, CODEOWNERS, and `.github/workflows/**` changes go in their own `[infra]` MR (enforced by the `isolated-ruleset-change` pre-commit hook).
