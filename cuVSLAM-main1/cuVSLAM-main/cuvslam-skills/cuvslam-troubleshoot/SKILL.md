# cuVSLAM Troubleshooting

Diagnose and fix issues with NVIDIA cuVSLAM — visual odometry and SLAM.

**Source repo:** https://github.com/nvidia-isaac/cuVSLAM
**Full troubleshooting guide:** `../../TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (read when investigating pose/tracking issues)
**Known limitations:** `references/cuvslam-limitations.md` — check this first if the scene has dynamic objects, reflective surfaces, IR projector patterns, line-dominated environments, or agile/drone motion

## Quick Triage

Classify the issue into one of these categories, then follow the relevant section:

1. **Build / Install** → [Build Issues](#build-issues)
2. **Tracking lost or inaccurate pose** → [Tracking Issues](#tracking-issues)
3. **Integration (ROS2, Python API, C++ API)** → [Integration Issues](#integration-issues)

## Build Issues

### Requirements
- Ubuntu 22+ (x86_64 or aarch64/Jetson)
- CUDA Toolkit 12 or 13
- `apt install g++ cmake git git-lfs python3-dev`
- CMake 3.19+

### Build from source
```bash
cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build --parallel $(nproc)
```

### PyCuVSLAM install
Pre-built wheels: https://github.com/nvidia-isaac/cuVSLAM/releases/latest

- x86_64: Ubuntu 22.04 / Python 3.10 has `cu12` and `cu13`; Ubuntu 24.04 / Python 3.12+ has `cu12` and `cu13`.
- Jetson Orin: Ubuntu 22.04 / Python 3.10 / `cu12` only.
- Jetson Thor: Ubuntu 24.04 / Python 3.12+ / `cu13` only.

From source (after building C++ lib):
```bash
CUVSLAM_BUILD_DIR=<path-to-build> pip install python/
```

### Common build failures
- **Missing CUDA**: Set `CUDAToolkit_ROOT=/usr/local/cuda` or install CUDA Toolkit
- **git-lfs not installed**: `apt install git-lfs && git lfs pull` (binary test data)
- **CMake too old**: Need 3.19+
- **Wheel ABI mismatch**: Match the Python tag, CUDA major, architecture, and Jetson family using the matrix above.

## Tracking Issues

Complete the three phases below **in order**. During Phases 1 and 2, run only information-gathering commands such as `scripts/inspect_rosbag.py`; do not convert bags, replay/launch data, or start tracker/replication steps until Phase 3.

---

### Phase 1: Information gathering

Collect everything needed before touching any tools.

#### 1a. Configuration file

**Always ask for the user's config before proceeding** — do not assume default parameters.

The config file must contain the cuVSLAM parameters the user had active when they observed the issue. Depending on their integration, this is one of:

| Integration | Config format |
|---|---|
| Isaac ROS cuVSLAM | ROS 2 parameters YAML (passed via `ros2 launch … params_file:=…`) |
| C++ API | Source snippet or struct dump showing `CUVSLAM_Configuration` fields |
| Python API | Source snippet showing `OdometryConfig` / `SlamConfig` fields |

If the user has not provided a config, say:

> "To root cause this accurately I need the cuVSLAM configuration you were using. Please share the parameters file (for Isaac ROS) or the relevant `OdometryConfig` / `CUVSLAM_Configuration` settings you had set when the issue occurred."

Key parameters to note once you have the config:
- `tracking_mode` (Isaac ROS) / `OdometryMode` (Python) — `0`/`Multicamera` is VO-only, while
  `1`/`Inertial` requires and uses an IMU. `Multisensor` is different: it automatically enables IMU fusion only when
  `Rig.imus` is non-empty, so the mode value alone does not determine IMU use. Verify the rig's IMU list alongside
  cuNLS availability, `depth_camera_ids`, and pinhole calibration.
  Knowing this up front directs the diagnosis toward vision, depth, or IMU root causes.
- `rectified_images` (Isaac ROS) / `rectified_stereo_camera` (C++ API) — wrong value flips the entire stereo pipeline
- `image_jitter_threshold_ms` — tolerated timestamp jitter between left/right images; too tight a value causes frames to be dropped silently
- `async_sba` / `sync_mode` — affects reproducibility
- `enable_slam` / loop closure settings — SLAM should only be tuned after odometry is solid
- `denoise_input_images`, `imu_from_left` — sensor-specific flags
- Any border/masking parameters — may inadvertently block features

#### 1b. Dataset inspection

Identify the dataset format, then inspect it to confirm all required data is present. **Read/inspect only — inspection commands such as `scripts/inspect_rosbag.py` are allowed, but do not convert bags, replay/launch data, or run tracker/replication steps yet.**

**Rosbag (`.bag` / `.db3` + `metadata.yaml`):**

Run the bag inspection script. Add `--vio` if the config has `tracking_mode: 1`:

```bash
source /opt/ros/<distro>/setup.bash
python3 scripts/inspect_rosbag.py <path/to/bag_folder>          # VO mode
python3 scripts/inspect_rosbag.py <path/to/bag_folder> --vio    # VIO mode
```

The script prints:
- `ros_distro`, duration, every topic with message count and Hz
- Required-topic check: stereo image topics (×2), camera_info topics (×2), IMU topic if `--vio`; warns on missing topics or left/right image count mismatch
- Camera intrinsics from the first `camera_info` messages (resolution, fx/fy/cx/cy, distortion model, zero-distortion = rectified)
- Stereo baseline derived from the right camera's P matrix (`baseline = −P[3] / P[0]`), with a sensor-model guess (D435i ≈ 50 mm, D455 ≈ 95 mm)
- All `/tf_static` transforms, with the IMU-related ones highlighted (needed for VIO extrinsic verification)
- Available TF frames (needed for `rig_frame` in the bag2edex config)

If any required topic is missing, report it to the user before proceeding.

**EDEX directory:**

Check that the following files/folders exist inside the EDEX directory:

| Required | File/folder | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Always | `stereo.edex` | Camera intrinsics, extrinsics, IMU params, frame list |
| Always | `images/` directory | Must contain `cam0.NNNNN.png` (and `cam1.NNNNN.png` for stereo) |
| Always | `frame_metadata.jsonl` | Per-frame timestamp and filename list |
| If VIO | `IMU.jsonl` | One IMU sample per line |

Open `stereo.edex` and verify:
- `frame_start` / `frame_end` match the actual number of image files
- Camera intrinsics look sane (focal length matches resolution, no zeros)
- Baseline (translation X of the second camera's `transform`) is non-zero and plausible (typically 0.05–0.10 m for typical stereo rigs)
- `distortion_model` is `"pinhole"` for rectified images — a `"fisheye"` model with zero params is a misconfiguration; see `references/edex-calibration-pitfalls.md`
- If VIO: `imu` block exists with non-zero `gyro_noise_density`, `accel_noise_density`, and a valid `transform`

If the EDEX came from an `isaac_ros_visual_slam` debug dump, note this — it will need to be patched before the tracker can use it (see Phase 3).

#### 1c. Ground truth

Ask the user whether they have ground truth trajectory data:

**If yes** — ask them to provide it. The tracker tool accepts a ground truth file directly:
```bash
CUVSLAM_DATASETS=<parent>/ CUVSLAM_OUTPUT=/tmp/out/ \
  ./build/bin/tracker \
    -edex <sequence_subfolder> \
    -edex_filename stereo.edex \
    -output_edex result.edex \
    -gt_file gt.txt
```
Ground truth enables ATE/RTE metrics in the tracker output and makes drift quantitative rather than qualitative.

**If no** — that is fine. As a fallback, per-frame translation differences from the estimated trajectory can surface large jumps or drift trends. For Isaac ROS / rosbag workflows, use the reference script `scripts/vo_pose_diff_recorder.py` to record these from the `/visual_slam/tracking/vo_pose` topic:
```bash
python3 scripts/vo_pose_diff_recorder.py --output /tmp/vo_pose_diff.txt
```
The output CSV (`frame_id, timestamp_ns, translation_diff_m`) can be plotted or scanned for anomalous spikes that indicate where tracking degrades.

---

### Phase 2: Prerequisites for accurate tracking

With the config and dataset in hand, verify these before touching the diagnostic workflow:

1. **Accurate intrinsic calibration** — verify distortion model and params match the actual camera. See `references/edex-calibration-pitfalls.md` for common EDEX mistakes (e.g. `"fisheye"` with zero params ≠ `"pinhole"`).
2. **Accurate extrinsic calibration** (stereo/multi-cam) — verify baseline axis and magnitude match the physical rig. See `references/edex-calibration-pitfalls.md` for wrong-axis baseline diagnosis.
3. **Proper image synchronization** — left/right timestamps must match per frame.
4. **Sharp images, low noise** — frame rate matters more than resolution.
5. **Textured, rigid scenes** — avoid repetitive patterns and dynamic objects.
6. **Correct parameters and coordinate frames** — check `rectified_stereo_camera` flag.
7. **Sequential frames with small time deltas** — no dropped or missing frames.

---

### Phase 3: Diagnostic workflow

**Only start this phase after Phases 1 and 2 are complete.** This is where replication, bag conversion, and tracker runs happen.

Read `../../TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for the full 14-step diagnostic flow. The summary below uses the same step numbers as that document.

#### Dataset path into the diagnostic workflow

**Rosbag (`.bag` / `.db3`):**
- Do NOT run the tracker tool directly on a rosbag.
- First reproduce the issue through **Isaac ROS cuVSLAM** (`isaac_ros_visual_slam`).
- Read `references/isaac-ros-visual-slam-usage.md` for installation, launch steps, key parameters, and how to verify it is running correctly.
- Use `scripts/isaac_ros_visual_slam_realsense_bag.launch.py` as the reference launch file for RealSense bag playback (Isaac ROS 4.3 — adapt for other versions). Pass `enable_debug_mode:=true` to capture a debug dump (EDEX + images) for offline analysis.
- **Quick check for pose jumps:** Before capturing a full debug dump, replay the bag at a very slow rate (0.05) with visualization disabled and check if the jumps disappear. Monitor `/visual_slam/tracking/vo_pose` (e.g. with `scripts/vo_pose_diff_recorder.py`) to detect jumps without RViz overhead.
  - **Jumps gone at slow rate** → the node cannot keep up at real-time speed (frame processing overrun, jitter). The root cause is a performance or timing issue, not calibration or data quality. Next steps: check CPU/GPU utilization during playback, reduce image resolution or publish rate, or tune `throttling_time_ms`.
  - **Jumps persist at slow rate** → the issue is in the data, calibration, or configuration. Proceed with the debug dump workflow below.
- **Container note:** If running inside the Isaac ROS Docker container, skill scripts (e.g. `vo_pose_diff_recorder.py`) are not mounted inside the container. Copy them to the shared workspace mount before use:
  ```bash
  cp scripts/vo_pose_diff_recorder.py ~/workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/
  # Then reference them inside the container as /workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/vo_pose_diff_recorder.py
  ```
- **Debug dump ownership:** The dump directory is written by the container as root. To work with the dump files, either run commands via `docker exec` or write output to a host-owned directory.
- **Patch the debug dump EDEX before running tracker** — the dump produced by `isaac_ros_visual_slam` has format incompatibilities with the tracker CLI. See `commands/debug-dump-patch.md` for the full list and the patch script `scripts/patch_debug_dump_edex.py`.
- Once the EDEX dump is captured and patched, proceed with the tracker-based workflow below.

**EDEX file (`.edex` + image folder):**
- The sequence can be run directly with the `tracker` tool — no ROS step needed.
- If the EDEX came from an `isaac_ros_visual_slam` debug dump, patch it first — see `commands/debug-dump-patch.md`.
- See `commands/tracker.md` for the full flag reference, all tracking modes, and worked examples.
- Inspect the output trajectory with `result_visualizer`.

**Converting a rosbag to EDEX for offline tracker use:**
- Use `commands/bag2edex.md` — install, config, and usage for the `cuvslam-tools` package (`tools/python_tools/`).
- Before converting, run `rosbag_extract_urdf -r <bag> -o /tmp/urdf_out -d <distro>` (see `commands/bag2edex.md`) to find the correct `rig_frame` for extrinsic extraction. Set `ros_distribution` in the config to match the bag's ROS distro.


**Steps 1–2: Reproduce the issue**

Follow the `#### Dataset path into the diagnostic workflow` section above for the correct path:

- **Rosbag**: First run at slow rate (0.05) in `isaac_ros_visual_slam` to confirm the issue appears. If jumps are gone at slow rate, the root cause is a real-time performance problem — investigate CPU/GPU load and stop here. If jumps persist, capture a debug dump, patch the EDEX, and continue with the tracker below.
- **EDEX**: Run the tracker directly.

Once you have a runnable EDEX, run the tracker in the **same mode the user was using** (match their `tracking_mode`, SLAM on/off, etc.):

```bash
CUVSLAM_DATASETS=<parent>/ CUVSLAM_OUTPUT=/tmp/out/ \
  ./build/bin/tracker -edex <sequence> -edex_filename stereo.edex \
  -output_edex result.edex -mode <user_mode>
```

Confirm the issue appears in the output (jumps, drift, lost tracking). Use the jump-analysis snippet in `commands/tracker.md` to count and locate jumps in the result EDEX.

Do not proceed to Steps 3–14 until the issue is confirmed reproducible here.

**Step 3: Inspect images** — Check for rolling shutter artifacts, blur, noise, corrupted frames. Frame rate > resolution for cuVSLAM.

**Step 4: Mask static areas** — Crop robot body / static objects from camera view using border parameters.

**Step 5: Run mono tracking per eye** — Isolates extrinsic calibration issues. Focus on rotation accuracy.

**Step 6: Verify synchronization** — Overlay left/right at 50% transparency to spot desync.

**Step 7: Run stereo** — If mono works but stereo doesn't → extrinsic calibration issue. Check `left_from_right` coordinate frame.

**Step 8: Fine-tune** — Resolution/FPS, brightness/contrast, denoising, motion model, masking. After tuning, validate with shuttle mode (tracker forward then backward over the same sequence — consistent trajectory = good odometry; large discrepancy = remaining drift or calibration error). See `### Shuttle-mode validation` below.

**Step 9: IMU** — Only add IMU for robustness (not accuracy). If the user is running VIO and the issue may be IMU-related, re-run the tracker in VO-only mode (`-mode multicamera`) with the same EDEX and compare: if VO-only is significantly better, the IMU is the root cause. Then use `debug_imu_mode` to validate IMU alignment, and verify the IMU-to-camera extrinsic transform, noise density values, and gravity direction for your mounting orientation.

  **Frame rate and VIO (sub-topic of Step 9)** — As part of diagnosis, try throttling the image publish rate and observe whether tracking improves or degrades. Use `scripts/stereo_image_throttle.py` (a ROS 2 relay node) with the SLAM node remapped to the `*_throttled` topics. Set `image_jitter_threshold_ms` to at least `ceil(3000 / target_hz)` to absorb timer scheduling jitter (e.g. 50 ms for 60 Hz, 100 ms for 30 Hz). See `commands/stereo-image-throttle.md` for the full deployment guide and launch-file snippet.

  Frame rate interacts with VIO differently than VO: at 30 Hz the IMU integrates over 33 ms (vs 11 ms at 90 Hz), accumulating √3 more drift per step and receiving ~6–7 IMU messages per image interval instead of ~2–3. This means throttling can make VIO worse even if it improves VO. Measured on a D435i dataset: reducing 90→30 Hz in VIO mode turned 368 jumps (max 4.1 m) into 995 jumps (max 16.5 m), while VO at 30 Hz had only 1 jump (73 mm). If throttling degrades VIO specifically, switch to VO mode (`tracking_mode: 0`) instead of trying to find a safe throttle rate.

**Step 10: Multi-camera** — Validate each stereo pair independently first.

**Step 11: Ground constraint** — Enable for planar motion to reduce vertical drift.

**Step 12: Enable SLAM** — Only after odometry is solid. SLAM reduces drift ~1% via loop closure.

**Step 13: Tune SLAM** — Tune loop closure and pose graph parameters.

**Step 14: Async mode** — Enable for real-time. Tune `throttling_time_ms`.

### Debug data dump

To capture diagnostic data for offline analysis:

```cpp
// C++ — dumps EDEX + images
config.debug_dump_directory = "/tmp/cuvslam_dump";
```
```python
# Python
odometry_config.debug_dump_directory = "/tmp/cuvslam_dump"
```
```yaml
# Isaac ROS params
enable_debug_mode: true
debug_dump_path: "/tmp/cuvslam_dump"
```

Then use the `tracker` tool and `result_visualizer` for offline analysis. If the dump was captured from `isaac_ros_visual_slam`, patch the EDEX before running the tracker — see `commands/debug-dump-patch.md`.

### Shuttle-mode validation
Run tracker forward and backward over the same sequence. Consistent trajectory = good odometry. Large discrepancy = drift or calibration issue.


## Integration Issues

### Isaac ROS cuVSLAM

See `references/isaac-ros-visual-slam-usage.md` for the full guide: installation, launch commands, key parameters, topic remappings, debug dump setup, verification steps, and RealSense-specific notes.

**Global localization** — Isaac ROS cuVSLAM does not support global localization without an external pose hint. Use [Isaac ROS Visual Global Localization](https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_mapping_and_localization/blob/release-4.3/isaac_ros_visual_global_localization) for this.

## Tools

- **tracker** — standalone CLI for image-sequence tracking. See `commands/tracker.md` for the full flag reference, all tracking modes, shuttle-mode validation, and output analysis. The output EDEX always stores only camera 0 intrinsics — having one camera entry is normal, not a sign of mono mode.
- **bag2edex** — convert a ROS 2 bag to an EDEX sequence for offline tracker use. Uses the `cuvslam-tools` package (`tools/python_tools/`). See `commands/bag2edex.md` for install, config, and usage.
- **result_visualizer** — visualize EDEX output trajectories (`tools/edex/result_visualizer/`)
- **undistort** — remove lens distortion from images (`tools/undistort/`)
- **cuvslam_api_launcher** — test utility for tracking + map save/load (`tools/cuvslam_api_launcher/`)
