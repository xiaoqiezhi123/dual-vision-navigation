# Build cuNLS (CUDA nonlinear least squares) from source via FetchContent, like the other
# externals. BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is OFF in this build (see FindExt.cmake), so cuNLS produces a
# static archive with its own dependencies (spdlog, cuDSS) bundled in; consumers only need the
# CUDA toolkit math libraries at link time. cuNLS reuses cuVSLAM's already-declared spdlog and
# googletest FetchContent entries (declared earlier in FindExt.cmake) and downloads a prebuilt
# cuDSS archive at configure time.

# cuNLS declares cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.24), but the Ubuntu 22.04 base images used for
# Jetson Orin ship cmake 3.22.1. cuNLS does not actually use any 3.24-only feature (it sets an
# explicit CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES list, not 'native'/'all-major', and only DOWNLOAD_EXTRACT_TIMESTAMP
# carries 3.24 semantics, which degrade harmlessly on 3.22), so we lower its floor to 3.22 at populate
# time. The sed is idempotent: re-running it on an already-patched tree is a no-op. Revisit this when
# bumping CUNLS_VERSION in case upstream starts relying on a genuine 3.24 feature.
# No DOWNLOAD_EXTRACT_TIMESTAMP here: the keyword does not exist on the cmake 3.22 shipped in the
# Jetson Orin base images (it gets parsed as part of the URL_HASH value and breaks the configure).
# On cmake >= 3.24 its absence only triggers a harmless one-time CMP0135 dev warning.
