        Track a rig pose using current image frame.

        This method combines odometry and SLAM processing in a single call.

        In inertial mode, if visual odometry tracker fails to compute a pose, the function returns the position calculated from a user-provided IMU data.
        If after several calls of Track() visual odometry is not able to recover, then invalid pose will be returned.
        Odometry will output poses in the same coordinate frame until a loss of tracking.

        To get SLAM poses, SLAM must be enabled in the constructor by providing a non-null `slam_config`.
        SLAM poses may have loop closure (LC) jumps when LC is detected and pose graph is optimized.
        SLAM poses cannot be adjusted retroactively, so use `get_all_slam_poses` method to get smooth trajectory up to the latest frame.
        Also, in asynchronous mode, LC is done in a separate work thread to keep `track` call fast, so SLAM poses are not updated immediately.

        All cameras must be synchronized. If a camera rig provides "almost synchronized" frames, the timestamps should be within 1 millisecond.

        Images (masks, depth images, etc.) can be numpy arrays or tensors, both GPU (CUDA) and CPU.
        All data must be of the same type (either GPU or CPU).
        This is not the same as `odom_config.use_gpu` - if odometry uses GPU for computations,
        images etc. can still be either CPU or GPU arrays/tensors.

        The images etc. must be in the same order as cameras in the rig.
        If data for a camera is not available, pass empty array or tensor for that camera image.

        Parameters:
            timestamp: Images timestamp in nanoseconds
            images: List of numpy arrays or tensors containing the camera images
            masks: Optional list of numpy arrays or tensors containing masks for the images
            depths: Optional list of numpy arrays or tensors containing depth images
            gt_pose: Optional ground truth pose. Should be provided if `gt_align_mode` is enabled, otherwise should be None.
            internals: Optional internal per-frame solver parameters (see cuvslam2_internal.h).

        Returns:
            PoseEstimate: The computed pose estimate from Odometry. On failure `world_from_rig` will be `None`.
            Pose: If SLAM is enabled, the computed pose estimate from SLAM, otherwise `None`.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If data checks fail (e.g. timestamps are out of order, images sizes are inconsistent, etc.).

        IMU sensors and cameras clocks must be synchronized. :meth:`track` and :meth:`register_imu_measurement`
        must be called in non-decreasing timestamp order; camera frame timestamps must be strictly increasing.
