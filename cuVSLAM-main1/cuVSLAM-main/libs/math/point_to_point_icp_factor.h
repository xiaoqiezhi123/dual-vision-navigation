// Point-to-point ICP cost: residual dim = 1, single SE(3) state block (tangent dim 6).
//
// Projective formulation: the state is rig_from_world. cam_from_rig is always provided;
// the kernel composes cam_from_world = cam_from_rig * rig_from_world. Each reference
// landmark is transformed into the current camera, projected to a single pixel, and
// compared against the depth sample there. The residual is the signed depth difference
// r = p_cam.z - d. The kernel also applies a fixed relative-depth gate to robustly
// discard occlusion-edge and wrong-surface matches; the threshold lives alongside
// the kernel (see kMaxRelDepth in point_to_point_icp_kernel.cu).
